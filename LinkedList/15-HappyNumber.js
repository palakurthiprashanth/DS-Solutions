/**
 * Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to number ‘1’. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach ‘1’. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers which does not include ‘1’.

Example 1:

Input: 23   
Output: true (23 is a happy number)  
Explanations: Here are the steps to find out that 23 is a happy number:


Solution: 
The process, defined above, to find out if a number is a happy number or not, always ends in a cycle. If the number is a happy number, the process will be stuck in a cycle on number ‘1,’ and if the number is not a happy number then the process will be stuck in a cycle with a set of numbers. As we saw in Example-2 while determining if ‘12’ is a happy number or not, our process will get stuck in a cycle with the following numbers: 89 -> 145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89
